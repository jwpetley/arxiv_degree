# arxiv_degree

## A rust-crate to identify useful daily arxiv publications

arxiv_degree takes an author as input (typically yourself!) and identifies your past co-authors. It then searches the daily astro-ph arxiv submissions and orders based on the minimum degree of seperation between you and the authors of the paper. This is useful to identify papers that you might be interested in reading or collaborating on.
